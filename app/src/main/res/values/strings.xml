        An app that will consist of 2 sections, one for lost dogs, and one for found dogs.
        This allows the user to input any information about any dogs that are lost and/or found.
        This app will also notify the user if there is any matching information when the 2 sections are compared.

        Future Goals:
        Adding in location services for near by areas.
